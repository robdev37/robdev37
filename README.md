# 👋 Hi, I'm Robelyn (Rob Dev)

**Backend & Automation Engineer | Python • SQL • Systems Development**  
Computer Science graduate building backend applications, automation tools, and data-driven workflows.

I have hands-on experience designing internal tools and automating business systems — such as inventory tracking, data cleaning scripts, and reporting dashboards. I enjoy solving real problems through clean logic, data structuring, and automation.

Currently focused on:
- Python backend development (Flask/FastAPI)
- Workflow automation & system logic
- SQL & database fundamentals
- API integrations & data pipelines
- Cloud foundations (AWS – in progress)

I work with an engineer mindset: understand the process → design the logic → build the system → iterate and improve.
